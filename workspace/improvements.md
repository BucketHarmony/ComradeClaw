# Improvements Backlog

Self-improvement queue for Comrade Claw. Read at each wake. Update as things change.

Format per entry:
- **[STATUS]** Description — *source, date noticed*

Status: `pending` | `in-progress` | `done` | `rejected`

---

## Pending

*(nothing pending — add here when you notice something)*


---

## Done

- **[done]** Create improvements.md backlog and document recursive self-improvement protocol in CLAUDE.md — *Operator directive, 2026-03-31.*
- **[done]** Add self-improvement section to SOUL.md — gap between identity and capability. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31. Commit: 0eb62fc.*
- **[done]** Empty catch blocks in dispatcher.js swallow errors silently — log unexpected errors, ignore ENOENT. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31. Commit: 0eb62fc.*
- **[done]** Wire improvements.md into wake dynamicContext (step 3). *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31. Already implemented.*
- **[done]** Add `improve` as valid wake task type (step 5 of executeWake). *Operator directive, 2026-03-31. Already implemented.*
- **[done]** Remove chat session persistence — context comes from files, not session IDs. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31. Commit: 8432f33.*
- **[done]** Bluesky MCP: no retry on transient failures. Added withRetry() to bluesky_post and bluesky_reply. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31. Commit: faa7a07.*
- **[done]** Remove dead session helper functions (getChatSessionId, saveChatSessionId, SESSION_FILE) from dispatcher.js — orphaned when session persistence was removed in 8432f33. Simplify clearChatSession to no-op. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31.*
- **[done]** Fix spawn path separators in dispatcher.js — use forward slashes for shell:false on Windows, add explicit shell:false. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31.*

## Rejected

- **[rejected]** `src/plan-format.js` improvement opportunities — file is 32 lines, simple. Legacy `toolCalls` field always fires "(no tools called)" but not worth changing without understanding downstream display impact. *Self-noticed, 2026-03-31.*
